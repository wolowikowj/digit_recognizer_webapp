Hi, this is a basic digit recognizer web application. The underlying model is a convolutional neural network that has been trained on the MNIST dataset, with some data augmentation to make it more robust to different handwritings.

My goals for this project were:
  - learn more about convolutional networks,
  - learn to deploy a webapp in streamlit,
  - learn to work with git

Ideas that could be implented in the future:
  - add options for different background and pen colors and make the webapp/model robust to different contrast levels
  - set up a pipeline to save drawn images and retrain model with them
  - make the model more robust to random drawings
